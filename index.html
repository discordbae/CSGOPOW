                <p>Valve has just released a new update that is drastically going to change the trading community. Once an item is exchanged between players, the item will not be tradeable for 7 days. <br> <br>This is the same as items purchased in-game or via the Steam Community Market. The reason for this change is to reduce the negative aspects of trading like fraud and scamming.</p>

                We’re also adding a shortened version of Nuke to the Wingman map pool. This version of Nuke features some experimental changes to the B bomb site, so queue for a match if you’d like to get a sneak peek.
